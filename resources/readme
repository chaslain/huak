This directory will contain zip files of sample projects for testing purposes.

I have elected to zip these so that 
1) it does not muddy the project
2) it does not interfere with a future .gitignore stipulation regarding excluding *.pyc files.

Since zip files are binary, this means no line by line versioning can be done by git.
As such, DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY.

If you need one changed, create another.
